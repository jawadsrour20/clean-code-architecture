# The Art of Clean Code and Architecture

This repository contains the materials for the talk **"The Art of Clean Code and Architecture"**, focused on teaching developers how to write maintainable, scalable, and human-readable software using proven principles and patterns.

## üéØ Overview

This session covers:

- What Clean Code is and why it matters (core principles)
- Advanced Naming Strategies
- Functions: the art of doing one thing well
- Error Handling: beyond try-catch
- Clean Architecture: dependency inversion, testability, and separation of concerns

## üß† Key Takeaways

- Code should be written for **humans**, not just machines.
- Architecture must be **flexible and testable**, not coupled to frameworks or databases.
- Small, focused functions and meaningful names boost team productivity.
- Clean systems evolve **incrementally**‚Äîavoid over-engineering and premature abstraction.
